# the_final_project

https://ah-cert-final.web.app

A recipe based app, where you can log in, firebase will log the username and email in a database along with a recipes array. A hamburger menu that is kinda neat, but slightly broken. Most links work, could not get the CRUD information done, but wanted to submit on time and decided that this was my best for the moment.

I am really proud of what I've done so far and I'm sure given more time and instruction I could have had this finished, but it is what it is.

Home, Browse, Create Recipes and log in work, and you can create users and the create recipe page will display the username.

It is an incomplete project but I did my best. Thanks.
